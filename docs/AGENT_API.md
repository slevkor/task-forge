# TaskForge Agent API

This guide documents the current HTTP API for people and software agents. The examples assume the API is running at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

All protected endpoints require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <JWT-or-agent-token>
```

Agent tokens are opaque, revocable bearer credentials. They are shown only once when issued. Never commit a token or place it in task text.

## Authentication and project access

Humans sign in to receive a short-lived JWT:

```bash
JWT=$(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"demo@taskforge.local","password":"demo1234"}' | jq -r .token)
```

Administrators create an agent identity and issue its token:

```bash
AGENT_ID=$(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/users/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Repository Builder","email":"builder@example.local"}' | jq -r .user.id)

AGENT_TOKEN=$(curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/users/$AGENT_ID/tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Local Codex token","expiresInDays":90}' | jq -r .token)
```

Add the agent to every project it should access:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" | jq -r '.projects[0].id')

curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/projects/$PROJECT_ID/members" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"userId\":\"$AGENT_ID\",\"role\":\"MEMBER\"}"
```

Membership is the authorization boundary. Administrators can access all projects; other users and agents must be members. A project owner or administrator manages membership, phases, and automations.

## Shareable project/task context

People can share readable URLs such as:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/?project=TAS&task=TAS-4
```

Agents can resolve the same context without knowing internal UUIDs:

```bash
curl -sS "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/context?project=TAS&task=TAS-4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN"
```

`project` accepts a project key or UUID. `task` accepts a readable key such as `TAS-4` or a task UUID. The response includes the project, the complete task (tags, dependencies, attachments, assignment, branch, pull-request metadata), and `updates` — every note on the task, newest first, each with its hydrated `author`. This is the one call an agent needs to resolve a ticket's full context, notes included; there is no separate call required to see whether a human has replied.

## Projects

```http
GET    /api/projects
POST   /api/projects
GET    /api/projects/:id
PATCH  /api/projects/:id
DELETE /api/projects/:id
PATCH  /api/projects/order
```

Create a project with `key`, `name`, `description`, optional `repoUrl`, and `color`:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"key":"WEB","name":"Website","description":"Public site","repoUrl":"https://github.com/acme/site","color":"#6554C0"}'
```

Project keys are case-insensitive and unique. A duplicate returns `409` with a message such as `Project key WEB is already in use`. Updateable fields are `name`, `description`, `repoUrl` (or `null` to remove it), and `color`; the key cannot be changed.

The project list is ordered by persisted sidebar order. New projects are inserted first. To persist a drag-and-drop order, send every accessible project ID exactly once:

```bash
curl -sS -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/projects/order \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"projectIds":["newest-project-uuid","older-project-uuid"]}'
```

Project membership:

```http
POST   /api/projects/:id/members        {"userId":"...","role":"MEMBER"}
DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId
```

## Tasks

```http
GET    /api/projects/:projectId/tasks
POST   /api/projects/:projectId/tasks
GET    /api/tasks/:id
PATCH  /api/tasks/:id
POST   /api/tasks/:id/dependencies
DELETE /api/tasks/:id
```

Task creation and update fields include:

| Field | Values/notes |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Required string |
| `description`, `definitionOfDone` | Optional text |
| `status` | `BACKLOG`, `REFINING`, `NEEDS_INFO`, `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `IN_REVIEW`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `READY_FOR_MERGE`, `ESCALATED`, `DONE` |
| `priority` | `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `URGENT` |
| `type` | `FEATURE`, `BUG`, `INFRA`, `UPDATE`, `SECURITY`, `DOCS`, `CHORE` |
| `assigneeId` | Project-member UUID or `null` |
| `parentId` | Same-project task UUID; cycles are rejected |
| `branch` | Nullable branch string |
| `dueDate` | Nullable ISO date |
| `estimatePoints` | Nullable integer from 0 to 100 |
| `phaseId` | Same-project phase UUID; omitted creation defaults to the active phase |
| `pullRequestUrl`, `pullRequestTitle` | Nullable PR metadata |
| `pullRequestState` | `DRAFT`, `OPEN`, `MERGED`, `CLOSED` |
| `tags` | Array of reusable tag names |
| `dependencyIds` | Same-project task UUIDs; self/cyclic dependencies are rejected |

Example:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/projects/$PROJECT_ID/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "title":"Add retry logic",
    "description":"Retry transient upstream failures.",
    "definitionOfDone":"Tests cover 429 and 503 responses.",
    "status":"IN_PROGRESS",
    "priority":"HIGH",
    "type":"INFRA",
    "branch":"agent/retry-logic",
    "pullRequestState":"OPEN",
    "estimatePoints":3,
    "tags":["backend","reliability"],
    "dependencyIds":["dependency-task-uuid"]
  }'
```

List filters are query parameters: `status`, `assigneeId`, `priority`, `type`, `phaseId`, `tag`, `minPoints`, `maxPoints`, and `q` (searches title/description). Task responses include `phaseId` plus a `phase` object (`id`, `number`, `goal`, and `isActive`), as well as `tags`, `dependencies` (with `isBlocking`), `attachments`, and the hydrated `assignee`.

To replace dependencies without changing any other task fields, use the dedicated endpoint. The request replaces the full set atomically at the application level; send an empty array to remove all dependencies:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/tasks/$TASK_ID/dependencies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"dependencyIds":["dependency-task-uuid"]}'
```

Each returned dependency includes its task key (`projectKey` plus `number`), title, current status, and `isBlocking` (`false` once the dependency reaches `DONE`). Self-dependencies, cross-project dependencies, and cycles return validation errors.

## Notes, dependencies, tags, and attachments

Task notes/updates:

```http
GET  /api/tasks/:id/updates
POST /api/tasks/:id/updates   {"body":"Implementation is ready for review."}
```

Reusable project tags:

```http
GET /api/projects/:projectId/tags
```

Attachments use base64 payloads and support PDFs, documents, images, and other validated MIME types:

```http
GET    /api/tasks/:id/attachments
POST   /api/tasks/:id/attachments
GET    /api/attachments/:id/download
DELETE /api/attachments/:id
```

Upload body:

```json
{"fileName":"design.pdf","mimeType":"application/pdf","data":"<base64>"}
```

Dependencies are managed through the task `dependencyIds` array on create/update. The API rejects cross-project, self, and cyclic relationships. Dependency responses include the dependency task key/number, title, status, and whether it is blocking.

## Phases

```http
GET    /api/projects/:projectId/phases
POST   /api/projects/:projectId/phases
PATCH  /api/phases/:id
DELETE /api/phases/:id
```

Phase creation accepts `{ "number": 2, "goal": "Ship the API", "isActive": true }`. Phase numbers are unique within a project and only one phase can be active. New tasks without an explicit `phaseId` are assigned to the active phase. Deleting an active phase promotes the highest-numbered remaining phase; deleting the final phase leaves tasks unassigned. The board defaults to the active phase; a selected phase can be shared through the web URL's `phase` query parameter.

## Automations

Project owners/admins manage generic task rules:

```http
GET    /api/projects/:projectId/automations
POST   /api/projects/:projectId/automations
PATCH  /api/automations/:id
DELETE /api/automations/:id
```

An automation has a `name`, `enabled` flag, `trigger` (`TASK_CREATED` or `TASK_UPDATED`), optional actor filter (`ANY`, `USER`, or `SERVICE`), `conditions`, and `actions`.

Supported condition/action fields are `status`, `priority`, `type`, `assigneeId`, `pullRequestState`, `phaseId`, `branch`, and `estimatePoints`. Condition operators are `equals`, `not_equals`, `changed_to`, `is_empty`, and `is_not_empty`. Action value types are `static`, `actor` (the user who triggered the task change), `user`, `service`, and `null`.

Example: assign a task to the changer when it enters progress and has no assignee:

```json
{
  "name":"Assign task to changer",
  "trigger":"TASK_UPDATED",
  "conditions":[
    {"field":"status","operator":"changed_to","value":"IN_PROGRESS"},
    {"field":"assigneeId","operator":"is_empty","value":null}
  ],
  "actions":[{"field":"assigneeId","valueType":"actor","value":null}]
}
```

Rules execute as part of task create/update and can update any supported task field.

## Users, agents, tokens, notifications, and search

```http
GET    /api/users
PATCH  /api/users/me
POST   /api/users/:id/avatar       {"mimeType":"image/png","data":"<base64>"}
DELETE /api/users/:id/avatar
POST   /api/users/agents           (administrator)
DELETE /api/users/:id              (administrator)
POST   /api/users/:id/tokens       (administrator or token owner)
GET    /api/users/:id/tokens
DELETE /api/users/tokens/:id
GET    /api/notifications
PATCH  /api/notifications/:id/read
POST   /api/notifications/read-all
GET    /api/search?q=retry
```

Agent token metadata can be listed, but the secret itself is never returned after issuance. Profile pictures accept PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP data URLs and are visible on assignees and task updates.

## Errors

Errors include an `error` string. Validation errors additionally include structured `issues`:

```json
{"error":"Validation failed","issues":[{"path":["title"],"message":"String must contain at least 1 character(s)"}]}
```

Use `401` for missing/expired credentials, `403` for project authorization failures, `404` for missing resources, `409` for conflicts such as duplicate project keys, and `400` for invalid input or task relationships.
